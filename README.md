What is Face Emotion Recognition (FER)?
Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is the technology that analyses facial expressions from both static images and videos in order to reveal information on one's emotional state. Examining a person's face, unless they actively suppress their expressions, can be one method of effectively discerning their genuine mood and reactions. Because of the universality of these expressions, facial emotion recognition is a task that computers can also perform.
